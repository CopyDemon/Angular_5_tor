TEMPLATE DRIVEN FORMS:
    1. add (ngSubmit) = "function()" in HTML tag
    2. add a variable equal to ngForm
       ( the ngForm is directive included with the forms module, we have it by default but it's be hidden so we use variable to get it).
    3. add the variable which one get the ngForm to function(variable);


    EXAMPLE:
        <form #userForm="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(userForm)"></form>
              here is variable               function(variable)
